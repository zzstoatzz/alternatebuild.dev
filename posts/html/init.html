<h1><code>hello world</code></h1>

<p>in 2024, we're going to try and write our ideas down more.</p>

<h2>ideas early this year</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>clever Assistant retrieval of highly annotated documents that embedded in vectordbs like chroma, redis and/or turbopuffer. Assistants can call functions, its time they use that to make metadata-filtered queries from natural language. assistants should also have tools to store <em>typed</em> key excerpts from interactions as documents, to make them referenceable in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>application state is just a <code>type[BaseModel]</code> on a thing that can patch its own schema with knowledge from the world. see <a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/marvin/blob/main/cookbook/maze.py">this example</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>imagine celery tasks as circumstantial nodes in a graph. they can be invoked at any time, from anywhere, including from other tasks. what if, hypothetically speaking, you could do horizontal scaling via k-means?</p></li>
</ul>
