  <strong>note:</strong> I know that most people are somewhere between political extremes and/or checked out of politics entirely. This post is concerned with the <em>influence</em> of these extremes.

<br>

I grew up in rural and conservative northern Michigan, went to school in Ann Arbor, then lived in Boulder CO and Chicago IL - that is to say, I've been non-trivially embedded in both extremes of modern American political orientation. I am (since college, where I was more progressive) moderate. I try hard to look at issues case by case and reject groupthink and myopic tribalism. I care deeply about people, but try to keep things in perspective.

<br>

over time, I (like many) have been frustrated with the detached and irrational moral condescension of the left. this post takes the existence of this (massively complex) phenomenon for granted, and instead focuses on the mainstream right's incessant and often cruel victory laps in the wake of last Tuesday's election. I don't think providing examples is necessary.


<br>

to me, “tit for tat” is an illegitimate justification for being cruel to “lefties” on the internet, or “watching them squirm” in the wake of recent events. tit for tat [may be a good strategy](https://youtu.be/mScpHTIi-kM?si=t42BlSP3QTlnkAwW) for self-interested militaries, but we are humans in society who can communicate ideas and collectively benefit from prosperity.


<br>

sadism is never just, even if you or a member of your perceived group have been wronged by misinformed people, those you disagree with, or actual sadists.


<br>

revenge is never just; it's weakness of character. leaders connect people by positively framing and inspiring action in the collective interest of disparate groups.

the quote is trite but bears repeating:
